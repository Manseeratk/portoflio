      <h3>VSCode Setup</h3>
      <p>For an optimal development experience, I prefer to work with Visual Studio Code (VSCode), a versatile and highly customizable code editor.

Instructions for setting up VSCode:

Download and install Visual Studio Code from the official website (https://code.visualstudio.com/).
Install essential extensions like "ESLint," "Prettier," and "Live Server" to enhance code quality, formatting, and live previews.
Customize your settings, keybindings, and themes to suit your preferences and workflow.
Explore the wide range of extensions available in the VSCode Marketplace to tailor the editor to your needs.</p>

      <h3>Terminal Setup</h3>
      <p>Choose a terminal emulator based on your operating system (e.g., Terminal on macOS, Command Prompt or PowerShell on Windows, or a Linux terminal).
Customize your terminal's appearance by selecting a color scheme and font size that are easy on the eyes.
Configure aliases and shortcuts for frequently used commands to streamline your workflow.
Consider installing additional tools like Oh My Zsh (for macOS and Linux) or Powerline (for Windows) to add extra features and visual enhancements.</p>

      <h3>Preferred Editor Font</h3>
      <p>Download and install [Font Name] from the official website (if available) or your preferred font repository.
Configure the font in your code editor (e.g., VSCode) and terminal emulator settings. Set the font size to a comfortable level for easy reading.
Experiment with font ligatures, if supported, to improve code readability by combining characters into more visually appealing symbols.</p>
